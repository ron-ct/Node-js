Routing - determines which functions Express executes when it receives a request for a specific URL such as / or /another/path

You have to pass two objects to a routing function: Express HTTP Request object (req) and EXPRESS HTTP Response object (res)

SERVING STATIC FILES- most web apps contain static files that return the same response to all users.
this can include: images, favicons, CSS stylesheets etc.
Express allows you to define a single directory that contains static assets and returns any file that matches the URL path.

callback function is a function that is passed as an arguement in another function and it is executed after the completion of that function.
its a key concept in asynchronous operations such as reading files and making HTTP requests.

EXPRESS MIDDLEWARE functions
app.use() - used to define a static directory.
Middleware functions run in the sequence defined in the code
all Middleware functions receive three arguements: req, res, next
next: is a callback that passes control to the next middleware function. next()
